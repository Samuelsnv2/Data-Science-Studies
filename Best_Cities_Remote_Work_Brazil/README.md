# Remote Work Cities in Brazil (2025) Analysis

This project analyzes which Brazilian cities are most suitable for remote work based on a combination of factors such as cost of living, infrastructure, climate, safety, and quality of life. The analysis is conducted using a dataset containing various metrics related to 20 major cities in Brazil.

---

## üìä Overview

The goal of this project is to rank cities for their suitability for remote work by calculating a **Remote Work Score** derived from several key indicators. This score incorporates weighted categories like:
- **Cost of Living**
- **Internet Speed**
- **Climate**
- **Safety**
- **Quality of Life**

Each city is normalized and scored using a Min-Max Scaler, and negative metrics are inverted appropriately to ensure higher scores indicate better conditions for remote work.

## üîß Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Cleaned and merged datasets containing city-specific information.
- Standardized city names across all datasets.
- Removed rows with excessive missing values.

### 2. Normalization
- All numerical features were normalized using the **Min-Max Scaler** to bring them into a common scale between 0 and 1.

### 3. Weight Assignment
- Categories were assigned weights based on their importance to remote work suitability:
  - Cost of Living: 20%
  - Infrastructure: 15%
  - Safety: 15%
  - Quality of Life: 35%
  - Climate: 15%

### 4. Score Calculation
- A **Remote Work Score** was calculated for each city by summing up the weighted contributions of the individual metrics.

### üìä Justification for Weight Selection

Each category was assigned a weight based on its overall importance to the quality of life and feasibility of working remotely in a city. The final Remote Work Score is calculated as a weighted sum of the following categories:

- **Quality of Life (35%)**:  
  This category includes essential factors for physical and mental well-being, such as healthcare, adequate housing, clean water, and sanitation. These are foundational to any long-term living situation.

- **Cost of Living (20%)**:  
  Daily expenses like rent, utilities, groceries, and transportation directly impact the financial sustainability of a remote worker. While important, it‚Äôs secondary to basic quality of life needs.

- **Infrastructure (15%)**:  
  Access to reliable internet and efficient public transport is crucial for remote workers but not as fundamental as health or safety.

- **Safety (15%)**:  
  Personal safety and low crime rates are vital for peace of mind and longevity. A safe environment is necessary for remote professionals to thrive.

- **Climate (10%)**:  
  Favorable weather conditions improve quality of life, though this factor may be less critical for individuals with different lifestyle preferences.

- **Death Rate (5%)**:  
  Serves as an indirect indicator of public health. However, since some aspects of public health are already covered under "Quality of Life," this metric is given a smaller weight.
